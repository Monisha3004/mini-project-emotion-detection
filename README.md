A real-time Face Emotion Detector project using Python typically involves developing a system to recognize and interpret human emotions from facial expressions.The system begins by detecting faces in each video frame using methods like YOLO or Haar cascades. Preprocessing, including resizing and normalizing, readies the data for analysis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) then predicts emotions by analyzing facial features, trained on datasets like FER-2013. The detected emotions are displayed in real-time alongside the video. This technology has applications in healthcare, education, and customer service.the challenges faced are lighting variations, cultural differences, and privacy concerns whic may make the system to predict the actual emotion.
